//                     Individual taxes are becoming more and more complicated year after year. Whether you are
//                     pulling your hair out trying to figure out how to file your own return or is someone who has

//                     returns are mostly done without interaction with the client. Returns that involve a Schedule

//                     follow up to make sure the return is done right. Regardless of a Returns complexity, clients
//                     may call for any questions and we will be happy to answer.
